# XKCDViewer
An app created with the XKCD comic API and Flickr API to view comics and produce a (semi) related photo


##Description##
	The “XKCD VIEWER” is capable of viewing XKCD comics directly from the source and offers the date of publish and title of the comic. It also searches Flickr for an at least semi-related photo based on the title of the comic or, if nothing is found, based on the alternative XKCD-provided description of the comic. Users are capable of browsing the comics using any of three buttons: a “previous” button that changes the comic to the one previous, a “recent” button that changes the comic to the one more recent, and a “random” button that changes the comic to any random comic from the XKCD archive (as of now, from between 1-1484). Users can also zoom in and drag both the XKCD comic and the Flickr photo.
